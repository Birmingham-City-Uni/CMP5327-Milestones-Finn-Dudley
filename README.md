# CMP5327 F-Dudley

This was a Project Repository for CMP5327 at Birmingham City University, where we were tasked to create a 2D Game in C++ using the [SDL Library](https://www.libsdl.org/), and its extensions (SDL_image and SDL_ttf). My created game was a Zombie Survival Horde Game, where the player can run around the environment and shoot multiple different weapons.

# How to Run the Program:

Once Running the Games Windows Executable, the game will launch to a Main Menu Screen, where you as the player can decide what map to play. 
To select what Map out of the shown selection, you use the number keys that correspond to what is shown on the screen, for example pressing 1 would start the first map, known as "Surrounded".

Once the enviroment has been created you can use either **WASD or Arrow Keys** to **move** the character and **aim the Character with the Mouse**, by moving the in-game crosshair.
The Player can **Shoot with Mouse Click or Spacebar**, and can **swap between weapons by using the number keys**, them being a **pistol [1]**, **rifle [2]**, **shotgun [3]**.
The Aim is to Survive as long as possible agains the constantly spawning zombies.
